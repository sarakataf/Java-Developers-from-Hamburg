Sara Kataf - XING Android Coding Challenge
=============================

I divided this project into 3 different parts. The first part was research, I was looking for best practices, best material design guidlines, best libraries for JSON Parsing, etc. The second part was coding and applying all the research I did. The final part was testing, since I didnt have time to learn and apply Unit Testing, the testing I did is to deploy it to different android devices that had different software systems.

I have tried my best, but I wished I had more time to do more research, more coding and more testing.

Thanks in advance,
Sara Kataf
